# Velociraptor (Server) in Docker

Run the [Velocidex Velociraptor](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor) server in a container with sensible defaults, HTTPS, and prebuilt client repacks.

- **Architectures:** `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
- **Ports:** `8000` (client/ingest), `8889` (GUI), `8001` (gRPC API), `8003` (Prometheus)
- **Data dir:** mount `/velociraptor` to persist config, keys, artifacts, and repacked clients
- **TLS:** self-signed cert generated on first run (you can rotate later)

On start, the container prints a small build banner (version, arch, base image, git commit, build date) so you can confirm what you pulled.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 -p 8889:8889 -p 8001:8001 -p 8003:8003 \
  -v $PWD/velodata:/velociraptor \
  xboarder56/velociraptor:latest
```

Open [**https://localhost:8889**](https://localhost:8889) (accept the self-signed cert) and log in with the bootstrap credentials below (you should change them right away).

## Runtime Configuration (Environment Variables)

- `/velociraptor/server.config.yaml` â€” server config (auto-generated)
- `/velociraptor/client.config.yaml` â€” client config
- `/velociraptor/client_bundles/` â€” repacked client binaries (.deb/.rpm/.exe/.msi)

---

## Common Run Examples

### 1) Run quietly (INFO mode)

This overrides the default, which is to run with verbose (DEBUG) logs.

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 -p 8889:8889 -p 8001:8001 -p 8003:8003 \
  -v $PWD/velodata:/velociraptor \
  -e VELOX_DEFAULT_USER=admin -e VELOX_DEFAULT_PASSWORD='S3cure!' \
  -e VELOX_START_SERVER_VERBOSE=false \
  xboarder56/velociraptor:latest
```

### 2) Set the public URL clients should use

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e VELOX_FRONTEND_HOSTNAME=velociraptor.example.com \
  -e VELOX_FRONTEND_PORT=443 \
  -e VELOX_FRONTEND_SERVER_SCHEME=https \
  -p 443:8000 -p 8889:8889 \
  -v $PWD/velodata:/velociraptor \
  xboarder56/velociraptor:latest
```

### 3) Use different public URLs for Client and GUI

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e VELOX_FRONTEND_SERVER_URL=https://ingest.example.com:8000/ \
  -e VELOX_GUI_URL=https://admin.example.com:8889/ \
  -p 8000:8000 -p 8889:8889 \
  -v $PWD/velodata:/velociraptor \
  xboarder56/velociraptor:latest
```

---

## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  velociraptor:
    image: xboarder56/velociraptor:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      VELOX_DEFAULT_USER: admin
      VELOX_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "S3cure!"
      VELOX_FRONTEND_HOSTNAME: velociraptor.example.com
      VELOX_START_SERVER_VERBOSE: "false"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"   # client/ingest
      - "8889:8889"   # GUI
      - "8001:8001"   # gRPC API
      - "8003:8003"   # Metrics
    volumes:
      - ./velodata:/velociraptor
```

## What to Expect on First Run

- The entrypoint generates a secure **server.config.yaml** and a **client.config.yaml**.
- Clients for Linux (amd64 + arm64), macOS (amd64 + arm64), and Windows (exe + msi) are **repacked** into `/velociraptor/client_bundles/` with your server URL.
- Youâ€™ll see logs like:
  - `GUI is ready to handle TLS requests on https://localhost:8889/`
  - `Frontend is ready to handle client TLS requests at https://localhost:8000/`

---

## Client Binaries

After startup, check `./velodata/client_bundles/` for repacked binaries:

- **Linux:** `.deb` and `.rpm` packages for amd64 and arm64
- **macOS:** repacked executables for amd64 and arm64
- **Windows:** `.exe` and `.msi`

If a specific upstream client binary isnâ€™t available, the repack step is skipped (youâ€™ll see a log message).

---

## Security Notes

- **Change the default credentials** via `VELOX_USER` / `VELOX_PASSWORD` on first run.
- TLS is **self-signed** by default; rotate keys/certificates as needed from the server.
- Expose GUI/API only where appropriate; consider a reverse proxy or firewall rules.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Seeing `[DEBUG] FlowStorageManager housekeeping run`?\
  You likely set `VELOX_START_SERVER_VERBOSE=true` (adds `-v`). Remove it to suppress DEBUG.
- Ports already in use? Map them as needed: `-p 443:8000` and set `VELOX_FRONTEND_PORT=443`.

---

## Tags

- `:latest` â€” current release
- `:<version>` â€” pinned image matching the bundled Velociraptor release (e.g., `0.75.3`)
- Multi-arch manifests are published for **amd64** and **arm64**
